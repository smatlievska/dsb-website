So life has moved me around a bit. I was born in Sydney, grew up in North Macedonia, moved to Slovenia for undergrad and worked for a year. Then, moved to the U.K. studied some more, and worked some more. But from throughout the journey these are some of my favorite accomplishments:

•Learned English, and Slovenian by moving abroad.

•Stayed in touch with my friends from Australia, although I was 10 last time I lived there. This included many years of writing letters.

•Represented my school in the UNIS conference in the UN HQ in New York. 

•Organized initiatives to support the visually impaired community in North Macedonia, including refurbishing the school for the visually impaired.  

•Worked two jobs in two different industries during my gap year.
